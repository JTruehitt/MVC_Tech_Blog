  ## Description
   I was tasked with building a small full stack application utilizing the concept of Model-View-Controller within a node.js environment. This was my first venture into sessions and cookies, as well as implementing the use of a backend database via a templating engine. In building this from scratch, I learned more about the interactions between front end and back end, and the need to make sure they are in sync in order to provide a good product to the end user.
